              About Aurras
            </h2>
            <p>
              Aurras is a music player app designed for instrumental streaming
              and serves as a platform for artists to showcase their original
              compositions. It features customizable options that allow users to
              layer environmental sounds, pure waveforms, and frequencies in the
              backgroundâ€”enhancing the listening experience for motivational,
              therapeutic, and meditative purposes.

              Role
            </h2>
            <p>
              For years, I've been listening to diverse instrumental and mixes
              to keep me motivated or to make me fall asleep when insomnia hits.
              With the help of piano pieces along with specific binaural beats
              in the background, I'm able to keep my focus and harness my
              creativity all day long. Not only do these types of music
              entertain and motivate, but they also offer inner healing and
              elevate happiness frequency. But often, the artists behind these
              instrumentals are not recognized unlike in mainstream music. So I
              want to build a community inside a mobile app where artists can
              show off their masterpieces and help listeners access them easily.
